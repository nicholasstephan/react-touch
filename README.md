# React Touch App

## Software being used

  * [React](http://github.com/facebook/react) JS library (so easy to use, and performance is great without even trying!)
  * [Zynga Scroller](http://github.com/zynga/scroller) for touch gesture physics (not in repo)
  * [Phone Gap](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.4.0/index.html)


## Setup

Add the local npm bin to your path so to be able to use local command line tools.

    export PATH="./node_modules/.bin:$PATH"


## Build and run

Simply run `npm start` to build all components and run in ios simulator.
