# React touch demos

This demo uses [ReactHack](http://github.com/petehunt/ReactHack) to build a high-performance, lazy-loading 3d intertial touch app targeted at the iPhone 5. It really shows off what web technologies can do these days.

## Software being used

  * [React](http://github.com/facebook/react) JS library (so easy to use, and performance is great without even trying!)
  * [Zynga Scroller](http://github.com/zynga/scroller) for touch gesture physics (not in repo)


## Setup

Add the local npm bin to your path so to be able to use local command line tools.

    export PATH="./node_modules/.bin:$PATH"
